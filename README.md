# ObscuraDarkAgesBuild

Drawing inspiration from classic arcades, Obscura is a unique turret-shooter game that offers a captivating experience. The game is controlled using a custom-built, Arduino-based peripheral. Players engage with the game by rotating a crank to maneuver the turret and navigate through game menus. To simulate the action of shooting an arrow, players pull on a lever and release it to launch their attacks. This innovative control scheme adds an immersive element to the gameplay, enhancing the overall gaming experience.
